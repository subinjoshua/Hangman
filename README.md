# Hangman
<p>Hangman game written in Python3. This program besides being the classic Hangman game, also scrapes the word's definition off the net. Fun way to teach yourself new words and their definitions.</p>

## Hangman_1 
<p> Basic Hangman game,the word-to-guess pre exisits in code. </p>

## Hangman_2
<p> This version of the Hangman game take the word from a text containing words</p>

## Hangman_3
<p> This version of the Hangman game is built upon the Hangman_2. In this version, for the word selected from the list,it's definition is scraped from the Internet and is provided to the user. A fun way to learn a few new words and its meaning.</p>

## Hangman EXE
<p> Converted Hangman_3 into py and exe </p>

## Further plans:
- ~~Next iteration will be using a text file with words in it and the program would randomly select a word~~ &#x2611;
- Will include GUI 
- ~~Make an executable in command-line with ASCII art~~ &#x2611;

## To  improve:
- Should try and make the code more pythonic. Include map,reduce and zip to do the same code
- Should learn and implement OOP
