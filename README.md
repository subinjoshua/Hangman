# Hangman
<p>Hangman game written in Python3. This program is to demonstrate my python skills after 3 weeks of learning python.</p>
## Hangman_1 
<p> Basic Hangman game,the word-to-guess pre exisits in code. </p>
## Hangman_2
<p> This version of the Hangman game take the word from a text containing words<p>

## Further plans:
- ~~Next iteration will be using a text file with words in it and the program would randomly select a word~~
- Will include GUI 

## To  improve:
- Should try and make the code more pythonic. Include map,reduce and zip to do the same code
