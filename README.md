# Hangman
<p>Hangman game written in Python3. This program is to demonstrate my python skills after 3 weeks of learning python.</p>

## Hangman_1 
<p> Basic Hangman game,the word-to-guess pre exisits in code. </p>

## Hangman_2
<p> This version of the Hangman game take the word from a text containing words</p>

## Hangman_3
<p> This version of the Hangman game is built upon the Hangman_2. In this version, for the word selected from the list,it's definition is scraped from the Internet and is provided to the user. A fun way to learn a few new words and its meaning.</p>

## Further plans:
- ~~Next iteration will be using a text file with words in it and the program would randomly select a word~~ &#x2611;
- Will include GUI 
- Make an executable in command-line with ASCII art

## To  improve:
- Should try and make the code more pythonic. Include map,reduce and zip to do the same code
- Should learn and implement OOP
